# Case Study:
One well-known GDPR case study is the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the unauthorized harvesting of personal data from 
Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica was a political consulting firm that worked on the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign for Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign in the UK.
The investigation found that the data was used to create psychological profiles of users, which were then used to target them with political advertisements during the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign and the Brexit referendum. 

## Resolution:
the resolution of the Cambridge Analytica scandal involved a combination of legal, regulatory, and technological actions aimed at holding those responsible accountable and improving data protection practices for users.
