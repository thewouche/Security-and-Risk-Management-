Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, refers to the integration of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and Robotics into manufacturing processes and systems. Here are two examples of Industry 4.0 applications:
Autonomous vehicles: Autonomous vehicles are one of the most prominent examples of Industry 4.0 as they use a combination of sensors, cameras, and advanced software to navigate roads and highways without human intervention. The technology enables autonomous vehicles to communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure, optimize route planning, and enhance passenger safety (Sell et al., 2019)

Additive Manufacturing: Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing. Additive manufacturing is becoming an important tool in Industry 4.0, as it allows for more flexible and efficient production processes, with reduced waste and improved customization. It can be used to produce a wide range of objects, from simple prototypes to complex components for aerospace and medical applications (Bandyopadhyay and Bose, 2015)

Although Industry 4.0 brings many benefits, such as increased productivity, efficiency, and flexibility, there are also some risks associated with this technological revolution such as cybersecurity risks. With the increased use of interconnected systems and digital technologies, there is a higher risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches, data privacy, and the protection of personal information. Moeuf et al. (2020) also highlighted that the skill gap is another major risk that industry 4.0 brings

Tupa, Simota, and Steiner (2017) corroborate with Kovaite & Stankeviciene (2019) by stating that Industry 4.0 generates new categories of risks as the key factor increasing the vulnerability is the interconnection of cyberspace, advanced production of technology and components, and the use of outsourcing of services.
