# Assessment types

Quantitative assessments typically involve the use of standardized tests, surveys, or other instruments to collect numerical data. The data collected can be analyzed using statistical methods to identify patterns and relationships between variables.

Qualitative assessments, on the other hand, are typically more subjective in nature and rely on methods such as interviews, observations, and case studies to collect data. Qualitative data is often collected in the form of words or descriptions, and is analyzed by identifying patterns, themes, and meanings in the data.

## Difference
One of the main differences between these two approaches is the level of detail that can be obtained from the data. Quantitative data tends to provide a more precise and objective measure of the phenomena being studied, while qualitative data can provide a more nuanced and detailed understanding of complex issues.

Another difference is the type of questions that can be addressed using each approach. Quantitative assessments are often used to answer questions about the frequency, prevalence, and distribution of certain phenomena, while qualitative assessments are often used to explore the underlying reasons and motivations behind people's behavior or experiences.

Ultimately, both qualitative and quantitative approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of approach will depend on the research question, the nature of the phenomena being studied, and the resources available
