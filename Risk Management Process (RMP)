The Risk Management Process (RMP) is a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks within an organization.
The RMP typically consists of the following steps:
-	Risk identification: The first step is to identify potential risks to the organization. This can be done through various methods such as brainstorming sessions, risk assessments, and gap analyses.
-	Risk analysis: Once potential risks have been identified, the next step is to analyze their likelihood and impact. This involves assessing the probability of the risk occurring, as well as the potential consequences if it does occur.
-	Risk evaluation: Based on the analysis, risks are evaluated to determine their level of significance and priority. Risks are prioritized based on their potential impact on the organization's objectives and operations.
-	Risk treatment: The next step is to develop strategies to mitigate or manage the identified risks. This may involve implementing control measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk, transferring the risk to a third party, or accepting the risk.
-	Risk monitoring: Once the risk treatment strategies have been implemented, it is important to monitor the effectiveness of these measures and re-evaluate the risks periodically.
