The field of security and risk management is constantly evolving, driven by new technologies, evolving threats, and changing business environments. Here are some some of the future trends in in the field of security and risk management:
- Zero Trust Architecture
- Cyber Threat Intelligence
- Integrated risk management (IRM)
- Quantum Computing
- Cyber Threat Intelligence

## Recommendation:
It is difficult to determine which trend will be the most influential, as they are all important and will have a significant impact on the field of security and risk management in the future. However, if I had to choose one trend, I would say that the Zero Trust Architecture approach will be the most influential.
The Zero Trust approach is a fundamental shift in how organizations approach security, as it assumes that no user or device is automatically trusted and requires constant verification of access to resources. This approach can help organizations protect against a wide range of threats, including insider threats and external attacks ((Bertino, 2021).
